### Step 1

Instead of fetching the photo on page reload, fetch the photo once the users clicks a button. Name the button `Ask me`

### Step 2

The current `Observable` is of type `any`. Create an `interface` to type the HTTP Response

### Step 3

Instead of fetching the information from the component, fetch the info from a service

### Step 4

Create a module that holds all the functionality related

### Step 5

Replace the button with one from Angular Material
